Automated Image Captioning from Web Pages

Objective:
The goal of this project is to automatically generate captions for images found on a specified web page. 
This involves extracting images from the web page, processing them, and using a pre-trained image captioning model to generate descriptive captions.

Technologies Used:
Python: The primary programming language for the project.
Requests: For making HTTP requests to fetch web page content and images.
BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML content and extracting image elements.
PIL (Pillow): For image processing tasks such as opening and converting images.
Transformers (Hugging Face): For loading and using the pre-trained image captioning model.
Salesforce BLIP: The specific pre-trained model used for generating image captions.
